# Basic Sampler
This sampler has a particular order when applying the other effects onto the regular effects, i.e. applying tremolo to a reversed sample. This means that when using the program, you will need to apply to other effect first, i.e. reverse, half speed etc. and then apply the main effect. 
When only one other effect is applied, the only way to hear this effect is to use the "play chopped" button, as it hasn't had a main effect applied yet. This is a bug which needs fixing.
